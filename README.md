An implementation of [apollo graphql](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) websocket protocol for [graphql-go](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql).

Inspired by [graphqlws](https://github.com/functionalfoundry/graphqlws)

Key features:

- Subscription support
- Callbacks at every stage of communication process for easy customization 
- Supports both websockets and plain http queries (with exception of continuing subscriptions)
- [Mutable context](https://godoc.org/github.com/lexycore/wsgraphql/mutcontext) allowing to keep global-scoped connection/authentication data and subscription-scoped state
